# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hello! My name is **Laurence** and welcome to my GitHub page! I am currently working at the **Quantitative Biology Center** as a data analyst, University of TÃ¼bingen. I am one of the core maintainers of the awesome [nf-core/crisprseq](https://nf-co.re/crisprseq/2.2.1/). This pipeline is within the nf-core community and is developed in Nextflow.

I also provide customised Python and R scripts for my various data analysis, and am doing 100 days coding exercise in Python.
