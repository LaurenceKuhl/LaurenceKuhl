# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hello! My name is **Laurence** and welcome to my GitHub page! I am currently working at the **Quantitative Biology Center** as a data analyst, University of Tübingen. I am one of the core maintainers of the awesome [nf-core/crisprseq](https://nf-co.re/crisprseq/2.2.1/):

![crisprseq_metropmap_all-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da18217-0c1a-4dfc-9e97-260328d99fcc)

This pipeline is within the nf-core community and is developed in Nextflow. For it, I developped small modules in R and Python using Docker/conda/Singularity and allows for a reproducible and containerised analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 screening (as well as targeting) analysis.

I also provide customised Python and R scripts for my various data analysis, and am doing 100 days coding exercise in Python.
